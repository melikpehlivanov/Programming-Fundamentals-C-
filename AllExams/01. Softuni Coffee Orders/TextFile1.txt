Problem 1. SoftUni Coffee Orders

We are placing N orders at a time. You need to calculate the price after the discount based on the following formula:
((daysInMonth * capsulesCount) * pricePerCapsule)
*Hint – The DateTime class may come in handy to calculate the days in month.
Input / Constraints
•	On the first line you will receive integer N – the count of orders the shop will receive.
•	For each order you will receive the following information:
o	Price per capsule - floating-point number in range [0…79,228,162,514,264,337,593,543,950,335].
o	Order date - in the following format {d/M/yyyy}, e.g. 25/11/2016, 7/03/2016, 1/1/2020.
o	Capsules count - integer in range [0…2,147,483,647].
The input will be in the described format, there is no need to check it explicitly.
Output
The output should consist of N + 1 lines. For each order you must print a single line in the following format:
•	“The price for the coffee is: ${price}”
On the last line you need to print the total price in the following format:
•	 “Total: ${totalPrice}”
The price must be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Output:
The price for the coffee is: $367.20
Total: $367.20

Comments:
We are given only 1 order. Then we  use the formulas:
orderPrice = 30 (days in June 2016) * 8 * 1.53 = 367.20

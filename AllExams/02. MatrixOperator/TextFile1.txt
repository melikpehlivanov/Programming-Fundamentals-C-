Problem 3. Matrix Operator
You are matrix operator chief, but you are tired of doing your job manually. You want to write a program, that will automate the process. The information you are processing comes from your boss, and he wants to see daily reports for the job.
You are given a table of integers. For that table you will need to execute some commands.
The commands are the following: remove, swap and insert. All commands come with 2 additional parameters. 
•	The remove command – type and position.
o	The type can be one of the following – positive / negative / odd / even. That means that you will need to remove said elements from the given row / col.
o	The position will be in the following format: {row / col index}.
•	The swap command – the 2 rows that you need to swap.
•	The insert command – row and number that you need to insert at the beginning of the given row.
•	The input stops once you receive the “end” command, and then you need to print the table after all operations.
Input
•	On the first line you will receive integer r – rows.
•	On the next r lines, you will receive the elements for each row.
•	On the next lines, you will receive commands in the following format:
o	remove {type} {position}
o	swap {firstRow} {secondRow}
o	insert {row} {element}
•	The input stops when you receive the command “end”.
Output
•	The output should consist of the matrix after all commands have been executed.
Constraints
•	The rows of the table will be in range [1…30].
•	The columns of each row will be in range [0…30].
•	The elements of the table will be integers in the range [-2,147,483,648…2,147,483,647].
•	The commands will always be valid and in the given format.
Examples
Input
4
1 5 2 -6 -2 54 -1
1 7 -3
-5 -3 1 5 6
5 6 -8 -8 -3
remove even row 3
remove odd col 5
swap 1 3
end	
Output:
1 5 2 -6 -2 54 -1
5 -3
-5 -3 1 5 6
1 7 -3	
Comments:
The first command removes all even elements from the row with index=3. That leaves the row with {5, -3}.
The next command removes all odd elements from the col with index=5. The only row that has 6 or more elements is the row with index=0. In that row on col-5 the element is even, so we leave it there.
The last command is swap row 1 and row 3, so we just switch their positions and print the result.

Input
5
-1 1 2 -2 3 -3
-6 -4 -5 -2 3 -1
1
1 2 3
-5 2 6 24
remove even row 3
remove negative row 0
remove odd row 3
swap 1 3
remove positive col 4
insert 1 50
end	
Output:
1 2 3
50
1
-6 -4 -5 -2 -1
-5 2 6 24

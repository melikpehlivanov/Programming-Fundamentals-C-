Problem 3 – Wormhole
Dr. Worm has advanced technologically to level where he can travel through wormholes. Wormholes are holes in reality, which allow you to travel to other dimensions. Dr. Worm however, does not know anything about the wormholes, so he just enters random holes in hopes of getting to his target point.
You will be given a sequence of integers – the wormholes, on a single input line, separated by a space. The integers will either be zeros (0) or some other integers.
You must start from the first one and reach the last one. 
If the integer you are currently at is a zero, you must continue forward to the next element of the sequence. 
If the integer you are currently at is NOT zero, it is a wormhole. You must go to the element which is at index – the wormhole’s value.
Every time you step on a wormhole, you must set its value to 0.
Your task is to calculate exactly how many steps it would take you to reach the end of the sequence.
The wormhole’s teleportation to the target index does NOT count as a step.
Example: If we have the input “0 0 0 2 0 0 5” . . . the steps would look like this:
 
Input
•	The input will come in the form of a single input line, containing a sequence of integers, separated by a single space. 
Output
•	As output you must print how many steps it took you, to reach the end of the sequence. 
Constrains
•	The count of elements in the input will be in range [0, 100].
•	The integers in the input will be in range [0, N - 1], where N is the count of elements.

Examples
Input:
0 0 0 2 0 0 5
Output:
9	
Comments - You start walking trough the elements. You make 4 steps and you step on a wormhole. You teleport at index (2), and you set the wormhole’s value to 0. You make 4 more steps and you reach the next wormhole, which returns you to index (5).
One last step and you have reached the end of the sequence.
The result is 9 steps.
Input:
0 0 1 0 2 0 4 0	
Output:
13

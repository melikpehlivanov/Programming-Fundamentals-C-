Problem 4. Files
You are given number of files with their full file paths and file sizes. You need to print all file names with a given extension that are present in a given root directory sorted by their file size in descending order. If two files have same size, order them by alphabetical order. 
If a file name (file name + extension) appears more than once in a given root, save only its latest value. If a file name appears in more than one root, they are treated as different files.
If there aren't any files that correspond to the query, print "No".
